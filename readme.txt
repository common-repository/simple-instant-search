Could be a miolion thing but the main reason is you simply need to add the shortcode to a page or a post,
so simply create a page/post and enter `[IS]`

= I have Found a Bug, Now what? =

Simply use the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/tags/simple-instant-search?forum_id=10\">Support Forum</a> and thanks a head for doing that.
